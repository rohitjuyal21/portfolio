        I am a self-taught frontend developer with 1 year of experience in
        creating websites that are easy to use and look good. I enjoy turning
        ideas into real, working products. I&apos;m always excited to work on
        new projects, try out creative solutions, and bring fresh ideas to life.
        Building products that people can use and enjoy makes me happy, and I
        love seeing an idea grow into a finished project.
